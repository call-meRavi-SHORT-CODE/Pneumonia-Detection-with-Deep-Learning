# Pneumonia Detection with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to build a deep learning model for the detection of pneumonia in chest X-ray images. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification. The dataset used for training and evaluation includes chest X-ray images from patients with and without pneumonia.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) available on Kaggle. Please download and organize the dataset before running the project. The dataset includes subdirectories for training, validation, and testing.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`:** Contains the dataset for training, validation, and testing.
- **`notebooks/`:** Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- **`src/`:** Source code for the deep learning model and any preprocessing scripts.
- **`docs/`:** Documentation files, including project overview, model architecture, and usage instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/pneumonia-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd pneumonia-detection`
3. Set up the Python environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Download and organize the dataset in the `data/` directory.
5. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for data exploration and model development.

## Model Training

To train the pneumonia detection model, use the provided Python scripts in the `src/` directory. Adjust hyperparameters, model architecture, and paths to the dataset as needed.

```bash
python src/train.py --data_dir data/train --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset and visualize predictions using the provided Jupyter notebooks.

bash
Copy code
python src/evaluate.py --model_path models/pneumonia_model.h5 --test_data_dir data/test

Results
The model achieves an accuracy of [insert accuracy here]% on the test set. For detailed results, refer to the results/ directory.
